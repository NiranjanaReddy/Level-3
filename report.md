# MECHANICAL DESIGN:  
## Assembly & Stimulation
I designed a simple two-finger gripper in CAD by first defining the finger geometry and the required jaw opening. The base, fingers, and sliding slots were modeled with precise constraints to ensure smooth movement.After modeling, the parts were virtually assembled in CAD to check alignment and motion. The final assembly was verified using CAD motion simulation to ensure proper gripping action.

## Computational Fluid Dynamics:
I imported the aerofoil model from Level 1 Task 2a into Autodesk CFD and set up a virtual wind tunnel environment. The inlet air velocity was specified as **28 m/s**, with appropriate boundary conditions and a fine mesh for accuracy. After running the simulation, I extracted the results to determine the **lift force** generated and compiled the findings into the report.

## Generative Design: 
I used Fusion 360’s **Generative Design** workspace to create an optimized GE bracket model. Starting with the base geometry, I defined the preserve and obstacle regions, applied the required load cases, and set material constraints. The generative solver automatically explored multiple design iterations, optimizing for strength-to-weight ratio, and I selected the best-performing design for further refinement and export.

## Piston and crankshaft mechanism:
I began by designing each component of the piston–crankshaft mechanism in **Fusion 360**, starting with the crankshaft, connecting rod, piston, and other necessary parts, ensuring that all dimensions matched realistic engine specifications. Once the individual models were complete, I assembled them within the CAD environment, applying the correct joints and constraints to replicate the actual mechanical motion. I then performed a **motion simulation** to check for smooth operation, verify clearances, and ensure there was no interference between parts. After confirming the design’s functionality, I switched to the **CAM workspace** in Fusion 360, defined the manufacturing setup, selected appropriate machining operations, and generated precise **G-code/NC code** for both the piston and crankshaft, making them ready for CNC manufacturing.

## Animation and rendering:
I started by creating the Lego man and Lego structure in Fusion 360, carefully modeling each brick and component with precise dimensions to ensure an accurate and realistic build. After completing the individual parts, I assembled them into a full structure, applying the correct joints and constraints to make it functional. Using motion studies, I animated the Lego man and structure, simulating assembly and movement to bring the model to life.

Once the motion was verified, I switched to the rendering workspace, where the  Lego figure stands on a narrow cobblestone street flanked by parked cars and tall buildings. The street is illuminated by warm, yellow-toned streetlights, creating a cozy yet urban nighttime atmosphere. The brick textures of the walls and the glistening reflections on the cobblestones add a sense of realism, while the Lego figure provides a playful and contrasting element in the otherwise realistic setting. The angled perspective of the scene enhances depth, making the Lego figure appear as if it’s casually strolling through the busy city street.
